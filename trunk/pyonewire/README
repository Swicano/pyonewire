this is the pyonewire module. it is based on nick piper's python-onewire
module. eventually, nick plans to incorporate those changes back in to his
module, but this repository servers as a temporary placeholder for my changes.
it's not really a fork, but i am maintianing it for some specific reasons.

the main objectives of pyonewire are:

   - to improve nick's original code to be a more suitable general-purpose
     onewire/ibutton inferface. (nick's version 0.0.1 is a useful feature
     demonstration, whereas this aims to mature its usability siginificantly)
   - to maintain the wrapped code with new releases from dallas
   - to realize, in python, all the features available in the C examples
     provided by dallas -- in an elegant, pythonic fashion

summary of improvements & additions versus python-onewire 0.0.1:

   - cleaned up (or sullied?) interface file to be compatible with latest
     version of SWIG.
   - dallas ib-ide source code updated to version 3.0b2 (latest available)
   - ibutton class restructured with ibutton-specific classes in mind. more
     object oriented
   - onewirenet rewritten to support network transparency and threadsafety; the
     underlying hardware interface (as definted by the swig-generated
     _onewirenet module) is no longer tied to the onewirenet module.

future plans may not be in this list; please see TODO for that purpose.

python-onewire is probably GPL, (c) nick piper
pyonewire is therefore GPL, (c) nick piper & mike wakerly
