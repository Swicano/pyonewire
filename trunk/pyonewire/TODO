- ibuttons.cfg should be replaced with a better format, or kept as-is, and
  completed
- need the ibutton classes to reflect capabilities, perhaps with subclassing?
  or perhaps just keeping the supports() function.
- some exceptions should be added to replace dallas OW_ERRORs; make error
  handling more pythonic
- test some edge cases: no filesystem exists but device supports fs (XXX -
  dallas library weakness atm?), etc..
- add support for thermochron, sha, other button functionalities. (more wrapping!)
- clean up typemaps - may be a bit of a mess since tar disaster!
- use distutils compile/install -- though swig support is kinda lousy. at
  minimum, autodetect python library path. (shoot, does this mean Automake??)
- network transparency. fooled around with an xml-rpc onewirenet
  implementation, but it can't handle abstract data types. which leaves us
  with: CORBA, or make all returns of onewirenet abstract? (ie, no ibutton
  classes)? XXX -- are you serious, xml-rpc can't marshall simple classes?!
- esoteric: re-sync dallas source trees to remove my printf-debug mtimes?
